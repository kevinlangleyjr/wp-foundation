#WP Foundation#

This is a starter theme based off of [_s](http://underscores.me) by [Automattic](http://automattic.com) with [Zurb's](http://zurb.com/) [Foundation](https://github.com/zurb/foundation) integrated into the styles. The theme was generated using the [Yeoman WP Project Generator](https://github.com/voceconnect/generator-voce-wp-project) by my team at [Voce Platforms](http://voceplatforms.com)

This is mainly for my own personal use, but if others find it useful and would like to contribute just submit an issue or pull request. Thanks!
